UD292 Live Coding with Canvas
=================

This is code built to support UD292 (Canvas 2D). You can run locally or in a workspace.

### Run

Start up a local web server (Python or whatever).

### Adding more templates

Add them to the `js/` directory.

### Deploying to workspaces

To avoid clobbering your index file when sharing a workspace across concepts, when deploying, create a different HTML file for every concept you use the code in.
